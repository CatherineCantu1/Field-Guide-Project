    <p>
      <p>An indigenous Mexican artist, was the creator of these wonderful creatures. The inspiration for Linares' sculptures has an origin as outlandish as the figures themselves. Linares 
      became very ill when he was 30 years old. Not having access to medical attention, he laid in bed and lost consciousness. Linares dreamt of a peaceful place that resembled a forest.
      He recounted seeing giant rocks, tall trees, and an expansive sky. In there, he felt healthy again, his physical pain was gone and he felt happy as he walked along trails through 
      the dense foliage of his dreamworld. Suddenly, the clouds, rocks, and trees began to transform. The land features around him shaped themselves into animals that were familiar and 
      yet like nothing Linares had ever seen before. There were mules with dragonfly wings, roosters with antlers, creatures that resembled gryphons and dragons, just to name a few. They 
      had unnatural colors and patterns swirling over their bodies. These creatures began repeatedly chanting <i>“alebrije...alebrije...alebrije!”</i> Linares became fearful of these strange, 
      powerful creatures chanting this nonsense word. He couldn't tell if they were warning or threatening him. However, it was enough to startle him awake in time for his fever to subside.</p>
      <br>
     <p>During the 1930s, Pedro Linares made <i>piñatas,</i> carnival masks, and religious figures from <i>paper mâché</i> that were sold in markets around Mexico City. After his dream, he began using paper
      and cardboard to craft large, vivid, ethereal creatures that no one had ever seen before, he caught the attention of a prominent gallery owner who marketed the pieces. This garnered so 
      much recognition for Linares' work, that Diego Rivera and Frida Khalo began commissioning alebrijes by Linares. Since then, alebrjies became celebrated throughout Mexico and abroad. Thus, 
      Linares was equipped to take a folk art tradition in a new direction.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Linares returned home to his native Arrazola in Oaxaca. He shared his designs with artisans in his village. A man named Manuel Jimenez was the first to create the brightly colored creatures 
      out of copal wood instead of paper mache. Jimenez incorporated Linares' visions into the pre-Hispanic woodcarving tradition that already existed among the indigenous Zapotec culture of that 
      area. Descendants of Pedro Linares as well as Manuel Jimenez's family continue to carve and paint various alebrijes to this day. Other artists have also taken the craft upon themselves to 
      create their own versions of the stylized animal figures. Entire families and villages have dedicated themselves to honing their woodcarving skills. They elevated the craft to a fine art and 
      built a unique economy based on artistic supply and demand. As the art spread, many believed that in order for alebrijes to receive that title, they should have at least three of the four 
      elements or have horns, antlers, wings, or fins.</p>
