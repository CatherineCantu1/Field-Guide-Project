        <p>To prove the remarkable impact alebrijes have made in the art community in Mexico, it is imperative to mention <i>La Noche de los Alebrijes</i> (Night of the Alebrijes). To date,
         it has succeeded in becoming a tradition for October, shortly before Day of the Dead. This parade exhibits work from contestants and artists around the streets of Mexico. During 
         the first four years, 392 alebrijes were created for the event, with 3,600 people participating in their creation, and had over seven million spectators watching live or on television.</p>
         <br>
        <p>Over time, they have also included competitions for story-making, writing, and musical compositions that go along with the theme of alebrijes. Every year, this event brings in a lot of
         visitors from other cities and tourists outside of Mexico, it is considered to be one of the most beautiful, enchanting, sights there is to see.</p>
